# Clustering Life Expectancy using DBSCAN

This project performs **exploration** and **clustering** of life expectancy data from various countries using the **DBSCAN** algorithm (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). The main objective is to identify hidden patterns and group countries with similar health characteristics based on life expectancy indicators.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Description

The key steps in this project include:

1. **Data Collection** â€“ Load dataset from file .csv.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Understanding the data through visualizations and statistics.
3. **Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection.
4. **Model Training** â€“ Applying DBSCAN clustering with optimized parameters.
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Interpreting the clustering results and visualizing the clusters.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains information on life expectancy across different countries, with features such as:

- `Country`
- `Sum of Females Life Expectancy`
- `Sum of Life Expectancy (Both Sexes)`
- `Sum of Males Life Expectancy`

## ðŸ”§ Technologies and Libraries

This project is built using:

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ for data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` â€“ for clustering and preprocessing
- `kneed` â€“ for determining optimal DBSCAN parameters
